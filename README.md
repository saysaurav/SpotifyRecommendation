# SpotifyRecommendation

This project is a recommendation system that uses machine learning to suggest new music to users, similar to the way that Spotify does.

### Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.6 or later
The following Python packages:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
spotipy
matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

### Data

The data for this project consists of a collection of playlists from Spotify, which were fetched using the spotipy module and the Spotify Web API. Each playlist contains a list of songs, along with various metadata for each song (e.g., artist, album, genre).

### Methodology

The recommendation system is built using a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

Collaborative filtering is based on the idea that users who have similar music tastes will also enjoy similar songs. To implement this, the system first calculates the similarity between users based on the songs that they have listened to. Then, for a given user, it suggests songs that other similar users have listened to.

Content-based filtering is based on the idea that songs with similar characteristics will be enjoyed by the same users. To implement this, the system calculates the similarity between songs based on their metadata (e.g., artist, genre, etc.). Then, for a given song, it suggests other songs that are similar based on this metadata.
